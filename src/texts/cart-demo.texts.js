    CRWN Clothing App is specific project for me. I've wanted to learn as much as I can on that project that's why 
    I'm calling it "never finished project". What do I mean by that? Every new tool that I am learning in React I am implementing
    and I am going to implement to this project.

    Trello is a simple static website to sum up my positioning skills using flexbox. Created using sass and compiled to one minified css file.

export const CartDemoCSSGrid = `
    Nexter is also simple static website to sum up my positioning skills using CSS GRID. Personally I love that way of positioning and it is my favourite tech to do so.

export const CartDemoFloats = `
    Flexbox is awesome, Grids are event more astonishing but we can't forget about older browsers and technology. So thats why I've decided to create grid using floats and make quite big static website using float positioning. Sass used.

So, E-Cancelary was just a first start with Node.js backend. I wanted to look under another angle on fullstack apps. Lately I used to make such apps using Spring Boot (Java). But since I am quite better at JS rather than Java I've given it a try. I'm not quite fully satisfied about this app, it needs to be repaired but hey, I wasn't telling You that it is finished right?
